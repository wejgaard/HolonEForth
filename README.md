# HolonEForth

HolonEForth combines Chen-Hanson Ting's universal eforth.fs and eForthOverview.pdf.

It handles source code and documentation together in a CMS and presents it in a book view.

- Chapters create files if the name has a file extension.
- Chapters, sections and units have a page each. 
- Chapter and section pages collect project documentation.
- Unit pages contain source definition and separate comments.
	- Like a Forth system with One Word per Block.
- Automatic Hypertext links throughout the system.
