# HolonEForth

HolonEForth combines Chen-Hanson Ting's universal eforth.fs and eForthOverview.pdf.

It handles source code and documentation together in a CMS and presents it in a book view.

- The Chapter and Section pages contain the documentation.
- The Units collect source definitions and separate comments.
- Automatic Hypertext links throughout the system.
- Chapters with a file extension contain the included source code.
